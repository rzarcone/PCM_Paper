    Get the channel capacity of one memristor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    FIXME: what should the form be? mean and standard deviation?

    vs : np.array, shape (n_v,)
        Voltages that are sampled.
    rs : np.array, shape (n_v, n_r)
        Resistances for each voltage.

    Returns
    -------
    c_cap : float
        Channel Capacity
